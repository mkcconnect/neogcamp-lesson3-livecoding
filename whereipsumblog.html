        <p>
            This is one my of early happy memories I think about a lot. It was the 2005 UEFA Champions League final in Istanbul between Liverpool F.C. and A.C. Milan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before 2005, although LFC had not won the league in the premier league era they had won silverware as recently as 2003, beating Manchester United 2-0 in the football league cup final. And of course there was the 2001 treble winning season where they won the Europa league, FA cup and the League cup under Gerard Houllier. Unfortunately after a not so impressive 2004 season Houllier was replaced with Valencia coach Rafael Benítez. But a good thing to come out of that season was Steven Gerard being appointed as the captain. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A.C. Milan had reached the final after beating PSV and it's derby rival Inter Milan. Liverpool had to go through it's English rival Chelsea and Juventus. The newly built Atatürk Olympic Stadium was hosting a UEFA final for the first time. Milan were the favourites. Every player in that team is regarded as one the best. Many were already European champions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I did not know any of this. Because I understood English I had started following English football. And I knew about A.C. Milan because I had seen an extremely low resolution video of his 40 metre 1997 goal against Atletico Madrid. After that night I got know how legendary the Milan squad was. It was stacked with best of best and coached by one of the most experienced and successful manager, Carlo Ancelotti.
