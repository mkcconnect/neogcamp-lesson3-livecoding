            Liverpool Football Club was founded by John Houlding in 1892 after falling out with Everton football
            committee. Houdling was the owner of Anfield and club president. Liverpool city, now in decline and rising
            poverty was an industrial town.
        </p>
        <p>
            Liverpool the city, with it's port and working class population grew rapidly during the industrial
            revolution. Most of the factories were unionised. The city iteslf grew at the expense of the exploited
            workers, many of whom were Irish immigrants who harbored resentment towards the British government. Many
            people in the city saw themselves closer to Ireland and Scotland than to South of UK and London. The workers
            at the docks would come to the matches to support the local Liverpool football club. Post world war as the
            British empire shrank, jobs at the port declined putting many workers out of work.
        </p>
        <p>
            By 1980s the city was in major decline and was on it's way to become one of the poorest cities' in western
            Europe. Margaret Thatcher became the Prime Minister of UK in 1979, and would stay in power till 1990 when
            she resigned after her leadership was challenged by her own Conservative party. She was dubbed 'Iron Lady'
            for her aggressive and uncompromising political leadership. She was a conservative and a neoliberal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city with it's unionised workers had a prevailing belief in socialist ideas. The club at it's peak in
            the 1960s and 70s had an ideology of sharing and working together and felt previliged to play for the people
            of Liverpool, almost on the theme of socialism. In 1980 the conservative British government saw this as a
            threat, and went full out to stop this spread of socialist ideas. When the city needed help, the government
            under Margaret Thatcher flatly refused to step in and left the city to die.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 15th April 1989 during an FA cup semi-final match between LFC and Nottingham Forest at the Hillsborough
            stadium in Sheffield, 97 people died in the human crush due to over crowding. It came to be known as the
            Hillsborough disaster. To allow more people in, a gate leading to a standing only pen was opened.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the following weeks, police and politicians selectively leaked and fed false stories to the most popular
            newspaper in the Britain, The Sun. These false stories ranged from accusing Liverpool fans of hooliganism
            and being drunk and stealing valuables from the dead at the stadium to a police horse being burned with
            cigarettes. The Sun newspaper published reports that the club supporters had kicked down the gate and rushed
            into the already filled stadium.
        </p>
        <p>
            After 27 years in April 2016 an inquest ruled that the authorities were negligent and the people were killed
            unlawfully due to their failure. The club supporters and people of Liverpool had always believed that the
            government wanted to cover up a failure and saw this incident as a way to punish the city.
        </p>
        <p>
            The UK government under Margaret Thatcher went to war over the uninhabited Falkland Islands against
            Argentina, refused to support the sanctions against the aparthied regime in South Africa, went on a
            political war against the miners to reduce the power of trade unions,and actively debated letting the city
            of Liverpool decline.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2013, she died of a stroke at the Ritz Hotel, London, at the age of 87.
